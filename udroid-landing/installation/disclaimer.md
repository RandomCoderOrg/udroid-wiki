* It may not be ideal for absolute beginners, you are required to read the udroid wiki before starting, and as well as a bit knowledge of how things in linux works, especially ubuntu.

* We do not work with any Ubuntu company or organization or any third party that contributed to the file system.

* The Linux you are trying to install from this repository is not fully functional in the target space due to SELinux policies and increasing Linux requirements, and because the project is set to work with ptrace () at a low level. access in android kernel. This leads to no hardware access, service fluctuations, performance overhead, sudo issues, etc.
