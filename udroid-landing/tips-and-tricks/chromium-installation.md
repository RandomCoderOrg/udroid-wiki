# üåç Chromium Installation

### Pre-Reading

In the newest version of ubuntu, chromium is set to be installed as a snap package and `snap` only works with `systemd` which won't start in an `proot` environment.

systemd needs to be started with PID 1 ( i.e at boot ), even if we found a hack to start systemd there are a whole lot of other problems like fuse file systems. like `proot` inability to mount images.

so workaround to install chromium is to switch to Debian repos and add an apt rule to install and upgrade chromium only from Debian repo.

Don't worry we made a script to take care of the installation
{% endhint %}

### Installation

just use this line after **starting your udroid**

```bash
bash < <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RandomCoderOrg/udroid-app-ports/main/chromium/install.sh)
```

easy as that

### Usage note

> By default, chromium is set to run without its sandbox feature cause of issues in root user and proot work better in root.&#x20;

> to run chromium as a root user from terminal user `chromium-nosandbox`&#x20;
